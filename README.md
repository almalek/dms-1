Single-user document management system

## Goal
Created with C#, this tool analyzes files created using a OCR-enabled scanner. Based on user-defined rules, the application analyzes the file contents, renames the file and moves it to the correct place.

All scans must be in PDF file format and either contain native text, or OCR was run before.
